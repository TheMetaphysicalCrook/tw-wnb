#Work notes using TiddlyWiki framework

TiddlyWiki is a reusable non-linear personal web notebook . It's a single HTML file which contains CSS, JavaScript, and the content. The content is divided into a series of sections, or Tiddlers. TiddlyWiki has been used by different people as a software framework to build specialisations including task management tool, web clipping tools, a collaborative note taking tool, etc.

TiddlyWiki - Work Notebook (tw-wnb) is a tuning version of TiddlyWiki for managing your daily work. It allows you to add to-do tasks by priorities(now/next/future), attach tiddlers to activities (or projects), write meeting minutes and more.

I have created this TiddlyWiki version because no other version satisfies my personal requirements. For doing this I modified some existing plug-ins but I have also developed my own plug-ins in Javascript, html templates, CSS styles, etc.
